# mtvjr's OpenComputer Programs

These are my programs for the OpenComputer Minecraft mod. Currently, you'll need to
download and add the oppm.cfg file to your computer manually as I haven't had my
repo added to the default list yet.

## My Programs

- tree: Prints a recursive directory and file tree from the current working directory
- wc: Counts the number of lines, words, and bytes in a given file or standard input
